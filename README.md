# Non root Docker conatiners

The Dockerfiles in this repository are just examples of using a non-root user in a Docker container. For an explanation go to my [blogpost](https://zawadidone.nl/2020/08/15/how-to-use-non-root-docker-containers.html).

**NOTE: These Dockerfiles are not updated and are just examples!**
